This a simple exercise that I had completed while, pursuing a course in Coursera - "Crash Course in Python, By Google"

Several python utilities have been used in this Jupyter Notebook like Numpy,WordCloud,Matplpotlib and fileupload.

While uploading a file:

    It should be a simple .txt file with natural text and no headings, bullets, serials etc.

At the end a word cloud in made, eliminating certain punctuations and common words like "and", "the", "is", etc.

The user can edit the string of punctuations or the list of non-essential words in the Notebook, as per need
